Pyicoregion
===========

Pyicoregion is a Pyicoteo module for processing region files. Its input is GFF files as the Sanger Institute defines_ it. The main function of this tool is to generate exploratory region files in the intergenic and intragenic spaces of any genome in existance. The following drawing illustrates the different region files that can be generated by the tool:

Pyicoregion arguments
---------------------

.. option:: --region-magic

    .. describe:: exons [position]

        Returns all the exons in the region file.

        If the optional argument ``[position]`` is specified (possible values: ``first``, ``last``), it will only return the first or last exon of every gene.


    .. describe:: introns [position]

        Returns all the introns in the region file.

        If the optional argument ``[position]`` is specified (possible values: ``first``, ``last``), it will only return the first or last intron of every gene.


    .. describe:: slide <window_size> <window_step> <region_type> [chromlen_file_path]

        Searches for intergenic and intragenic regions using sliding windows.

        Mandatory arguments are ``<window_size>`` (the size of the sliding window), ``<window_step>`` (the distance between the start position of every consecutive window. It must be lower than or equal to the window size) and ``<region_type>`` (must be ``inter``, for intergenic, or ``intra``, for intragenic regions).

        The optional argument ``[chromlen_file_path]`` is used to specify the path to the file containing the chromosome lengths (Pyicoteo's own chromlen files can be found in pyicoteolib/chromlen/). If it is not specified for intergenic regions, the results for the last regions of the chromosomes might be wrong.

        Note: if the last segment of a region is shorter than the window size, the step distance is decreased by the difference (the window size stays the same).

        Note: regions shorter than the window size are ignored.


    .. describe:: tss <add_start> <add_end>

        Returns the TSS for every transcript in the region file.

        Due to a TSS being a single point, the arguments ``<add_start>`` and ``<add_end>`` specify the values added to the start and end of every TSS (taking into consideration the strand). For pyicoregion to work correctly, they must be non-negative integers. Also, if the strand is not specified, the regions will be treated as if they were positive.


.. option:: --gff-file <gff_file_path>

    Used to specify the path of the GFF file containing the regions. This argument is mandatory for all operations involving regions.
