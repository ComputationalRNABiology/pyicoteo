Getting Started
===============


Download & Install
------------------


**Download Pyicos**  `Latest version`_ from our Sourceforge repository.

.. _`Latest version`: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyicos/ 



Eventhough you can use it directly (without installing) we recommend to **install it**. To do so decompress the folder and run the setup.py script with administrator privileges:

    python setup.py install

Pyicos has no dependencies other than Python 2.5 or higher. Pyicos is not yet compatible with Python 3.

Check installation
------------------

To test that the software was installed correctly, start a python console and try importing it by typing::

    python
    >>> import pyicoslib
    >>> import pyicoslib.core
