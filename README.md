Pyicoteo 
========

Pyicoteo* is a suite of tools for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. It works with genomic coordinates, it was mainly developed using Solexa/Illumina mapped reads, but in it's core is platform-agnostic, since in many cases, it works with genomic coordinates. There are currently 6 different tools (5 command-line based, one configuration file based) and a python library for scripting.

`* Pronounced as in Spanish  "picoteo"_ /pɪkɒtɛɒ/: (n) Appetizer-type foods that accompany drinks before or instead of a meal)`
